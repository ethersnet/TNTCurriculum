Thank you for helping make the TNT curriculum better. Please refer to this guide when making changes to the repo.

## Submitting a pull request

Submit pull requests for spelling, grammar, clarity, and additional resources in existing lessons or additional reference guides.

1. Please create a branch for your change.
2. In the pull request, describe the changes you've made.
3. A TNT Curriculum admin will sign-off on the change before merging.

## Opening an issue

Open an issue for concept changes or introductions, for proposals of additional topics to cover,  questions about why a certain tool or technology was selected or not selected for inclusion in the curriculum, or changes to the design phases curriculum decks. This will kick of a discussion and we'll choose a course of action from the resolution.

## Questions about a deliverable

First reach out to instructors or coaches, especially if it is about your particular work or project. They will be able to unblock you quickly. If you think the general instructions are unclear or out of date submit a pull request or open an issue. (See above for details.)
