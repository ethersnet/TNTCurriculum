Web development curriculum for The New Technologist Summer Academy - Welcome to the TNT curriculum. The course introduces web app development with TypeScript and React using Visual Studio Code, Git, and GitHub combined with a design sprint, product thinking, and project management. New Technologists use these skills to build incredible prototype applications. The course is infused with the experience of TNT mentors and coaches, connecting what's learned back to industry product development.

## How to use these materials

* **Instructors** - lesson material
* **Coaches and mentors** - map to connect where teams are at throughout the program
* **New Technologists** - reference to review and expand your learning

## Overview

The curriculum is divided into five threads that span five weeks.

* **Product thinking** - going from a problem statement to an impactful experience and pitch, delivering as a team.
* **Git and GitHub** - using version control and managing a project with a team.
* **Web design** - building a web application with HTML, CSS, and React.
* **Typescript programming** - building a web application with VS Code and TypeScript.

The course is applied to the application development process end to end, from identifying user needs to building a prototype. The course accumulates with NTs building and pitching an app prototype.
