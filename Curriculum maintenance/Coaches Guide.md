# Coaches guide

This resource is aimed at coaches to follow the curriculum, guide prototype development, and infuse the curriculum with real-world product and development experiences. It's a guide, adapt to your team and where they're at.

**Remote note**: depending on EST or PST your team may have not yet dug into the PM concepts of the day. As a best practice check-in on where they're at. Revisit the activities from the previous day and touch on core concepts of the upcoming day.

## Week 0

NTs are onboarding.

## Week 1

This week introduces the basic technologies and tools the prototypes will be built with. NTs begin building with TypeScript and React in VS Code. NTs are also introduced to Git and the basic Git flow. The week ends with NTs building a basic list app.

NT groups are given a broad problem statement. NTs are introduced to the product development lifecycle and work in teams to break down the problem statement into concrete and addressable user needs. This week includes activities to empathize with the user, define user needs, ideate and sketch.

### Day 1

#### tl;dr

* Kick off with your team and get to know one another!
* Check in on getting started with the engineering tools and tech - VS Code, TS, React.
* Revisit the [Intro to PM and Design thinking](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum/blob/main/Reference/Product%20decks/1.0%20-%20Intro%20to%20pm%20and%20design%20thinking.pdf) content with your team, especially - the PM role design thinking phases, MVP, and agile development.
* Encouraging having conversations in the team channel, and keeping all files there.

#### Details

Kick off with your team and the product lifecycle! Two main objectives - start to get to know everyone and review the [Intro to PM and Design thinking](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum/blob/main/Reference/Product%20decks/1.0%20-%20Intro%20to%20pm%20and%20design%20thinking.pdf). Start with introductions, names and pronouns. Consider an ice breaker like:

* If you could have lunch with anyone, who would it be?
* What was your favorite course?
* Where do you most want to travel to?

Share about yourself, what you work on and what you do outside of work. Ask the NTs the same.

Kick off a discussion on how getting started is going, ask NTs about:

* VS Code and TypeScript - were they able to get started and up and running?
* Things going ok with Teams and Outlook, any questions?

Talk about concepts related to the Intro to PM and Design thinking deck with your team. Depending on timezone your team may or may not have read document yet. Key touch points:

* PM role - discuss your work as a PM and the range of the PM roles and responsibilities. It's a unique opportunity with the program for the NTs to experience both PM and engineering.
* Design thinking - talk about the schedule and progressing through these phases over the next two weeks. Help the NTs map this to the prototype they're building as an output. At this point it's critical to step away from the details of implementation and get ready to empathize with users and think boldly and broadly.
* MVP - revisit the concept of an MVP. The NTs will shape their MVP for their prototype with their spec.
* Agile development - give an example of how your team or product uses agile engineering. Talk through your experiences with a sprint. Talk through a time or project you used waterfall method with. Reinforce that the program will bring in aspects of agile development.

Time permitting, lead your team through an exercise of designing a product. Start with a broad problem statement like "design a ticket machine" or "design a refrigerator". Make sure they keep the customer at the center, walk through who it's for and some common needs or problems it must address.

Check that your team has created a channel under their group. Encourage them to have discussions here rather than a private chat so you can stay connected. Reinforce keeping files there as well.

### Day 2

#### tl;dr

* Groups get their problem statements! Check in on how they feel - excited? disappointed? nervous?
* [Empathize with users](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum/blob/main/Reference/Product%20decks/1.1%20-%20Empathize%20with%20users.pdf) introduces the role of UX researcher and empathy mapping. Reiterate that this phase is about learning what the users need and their problems, rather than jumping to a solution.
* Check in on how they are doing with the activities - just getting started, well underway? Any questions? Give an example of how user research has impacted your product or works.
* NTs started on Git learning with the introduction to Git and the local workflow. Share about your experience learning Git.

#### Details

Each group received their problem statement today. It was posted in the General channel for the group in the morning. Your team may be at various phases of digesting the problem statement. Check-in with your team and get their read on whether or not they're excited. This is a chance to encourage a resilient and growth mindset if they were hoping for a different one.

This kicks off the empathize design phase! The goal is to develop a deep, empathetic understanding of the user needs by observing, engaging and immersing. Reiterate that at this point it's not about finding the solution but figure out what you're going to solve for. NTs have started activities to uncover these needs and build an empathy map. Tomorrow they'll narrow on a particular target audience, starting with broader explorations o the problem space today.

* Check-in on how it's going, how they divided the work, and encourage the use of OneNote if it's not already there.
* If well underway, have the NTs talk through the empathy map and share the key pain points they've found.
* Be on the look out for talk of the app they're going to build or particular features. Bring the discussion back to what they're learning about the user.

NTs engineering focus today is on Git. Check-in on questions, share your experience with source control, Git, and re-encourage that it's a learned skill that takes practice.

### Day 3

#### tl;dr

* It's been a busy week, consider a one word check-in or some way to share how it's going.
* Teams should have wrapped up with empathize investigation activities and moved onto the [define phase](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum/blob/main/Reference/Product%20decks/1.2%20-%20Define%20needs.pdf). Check-in on where they're at in this process and ask to see the latest work.
* Push to keep the discussion solution agnostic and rooted in user needs if you see it drifting towards a particular application.
* Today the NTs are also introduced to the create React app tool. Ask for demo or dive into a discussion on the basics of web architecture.

#### Details

It has been a big week with many introductions, new tools, and getting in a rhythm working as a team. Ask everyone how they're doing or feeling at this moment with one word. Share your own thoughts as well, and encourage creating connections, how you're feeling, and any thoughts about getting started and/or something new. Look for positive and negative trends to pull more info out on.

NTs have begun the [define](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum/blob/main/Reference/Product%20decks/1.2%20-%20Define%20needs.pdf) phase and are refining towards an addressable problem statement. They're identifying their specific target audience and creating user journey maps. See where they are in the process and if they have any questions:

* At this point the discussions should be solution agnostic, not talking about specific applications or features.
* Check-in and make sure all NTs are participating in the activities. Even if it's not their favorite part of the program it's important to take the time in these phases to make sure you build something great. Everyone has something to contribute that expands thinking here.
* Depending on the timing, NTs may have come up with problem statements and created an affinity diagram. Ask for a tour. Look for trends they may not have seen or help them expand if the problem statements are too narrow.

On the engineering side of the focus is getting started with create React app.

* Prompt a discussion around the architecture of a web app.
* Ask for demo.
* Ask the team to explain how all the pieces they've learned so far work together. Fill in any unknowns as a group.

### Day 4

#### tl;dr

* Set the tone for open brainstorming with great ideas pitch or an activity to build support of ideas in brainstorming.
* Today the NTs enter the [ideation phase](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum/blob/main/Reference/Product%20decks/1.3%20-%20HMW%20and%20ideation.pdf), using a how might we exercise to come up with two potential problem statements as a team. Check-in on where they're at in the process. Ensure that all perspectives are represented.
* NTs started with the list app work, the first project. Ask for a volunteer to share where they're at and open the floor to questions on the work.

#### Details

Consider kicking off today with an activity that focuses on big ideas and building off one another. Set the tone for how you can work together on product ideas. Great idea pitch is an exercise where everyone takes turns pitching from a list of not so great ideas. Introduce this activity through a how might we statement, and give an example of bad idea. For example, for 2 minutes let's create a list of the worst possible way to - "make fast food restaurants faster" Examples:

* "Don't let cars stop..."
* "Leave food partially cooked so people can cook it at home"
...

Next the ideas are pitched. Everyone gets a minute. Randomly choose an idea from the list. Pitch why it is the best idea ever. Build off of one another. There are no bad ideas here... only ideas that need a creative pitch. Start if no one volunteers.

The NTs have begun the ideation phase, beginning to come up with solutions and further refine the exact problem statement they're going to tackle with their prototypes. Encourage broad thinking. Depending on team progress ask to see Crazy 8s or join in a round if they're in the middle. Ask to see their HMW affinity diagram.

On the engineering side, today NTs were introduced to the to-do sample app project. It brings together TS, React and the tools from this week. The focus is on the basic functionality over visuals.

* Poll for how everyone is feeling about the project. Ask for someone to walk through the project goal and what they're working on.
* Check-in on using the Git workflow locally, committing changes as they go. Next week the NTs will cover remote repositories and create a repo in GitHub.
* Ask for a demo or for someone to share where they're at.

## Day 5

7/3 Holiday - everyone has the day off

## Week 2

Early in the week NTs continue and wrap up working on their list app. In the Git learning track, NTs are introduced to remote repositories.  Applying, NTs move their list app to GitHub. Components are introduced early in the week and re-iterated throughout, along with UI debugging.

Working through the design phases, NTs  start the first iteration of the prototype and test. NTs create paper prototypes, begin early usability testing completing 2-3 interviews each by end of week, and create first drafts of their value prop and pitch. This is a great chance for the teams to get feedback on their concepts. Volunteer as a participant and listen to the pitch. The teams will still go through phases of expanding and refining app and feature ideas. When lost or debating, evaluate the solution to the problem statement against how well it meets the user needs.

NTs may ask or seek out people in their target audience to test with. This is great! Each NT should conduct pilot rounds with other NTs or people they're living with, and vet the study preparedness with coaches.

* Be a participant and review their study material and execution. Make sure it's ready to go with an audience and their interview skills are up to par.
* Make sure they have a plan for the interview logistics remotely and they're valuing the participants time. NTs are representing the program.
* If the NTs don't have connections to their target audience, if you're comfortable connect them with someone you know or reach out in the coaches chat to make connections.

### Day 1

#### tl;dr

* Reconnect after the long weekend.
* Teams are introduced to [Usability and interviewing](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum/blob/main/Reference/Product%20decks/2.0%20-%20Usability%20and%20interviewing.pdf) and begin creating their interview guide. Check in and volunteer to practice.
* Remote repositories are introduced. NTs move to-do apps to a remote repository and begin working there.

#### Details

NTs wrapped up last week with ideation. There may be mixed feelings heading into the second week excited or disappointed, fatigued or re-energized. Ask about the long weekend, share about your weekend and gauge where everyone is at.

Check-in and talk through the concept of remote repositories and strategies for Git back tracking.

On the product side, NTs will learn about user research and usability testing. Both coaches share about your user research experiences and being customer driven. Talk about how your feature crews have worked with user researchers. NTs have begun writing their user research guide. The guide focus today is goals, what they want to learn, and interview questions. Tomorrow they'll work on paper prototypes and then define their usability tasks.

At this stage it's a great chance for NTs to get feedback on their concepts. It's not time yet for a high-fidelity usability test, rather to get feedback and learn more on needs and pain points and begin early future validation.

* Volunteer to be interviewed as a participant.
* Look for open-ended, non-leading questions.
* Complete the interview and then give feedback at the end.

Again, check that the interview guide is saved somewhere shared in Teams, either a Word doc or OneNote.

### Day 2

#### tl;dr

* Components and methods are introduced including class and function components, along with React lifecycle methods.
* NTs are introduced to the large screen vs. small screen MVP question. It's not about features, which would they build first that best meets user needs?
* NTs review [Prototype and test](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum/blob/main/Reference/Product%20decks/2.1%20-%20Prototype%20and%20test.pdf) with why prototype and different methods. NTs begin creating paper prototypes, individually and then combine into a generally shared version maybe with a few options.

#### Details

NTs reach the [React component lifecycle](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum/blob/main/Week%202/%5BENG2.1%5DComponents.md). This is one of the more in-depth technical concepts in the curriculum. Encourage NTs to keep at if they first don't grasp the concepts.

In [Prototype and test](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum/blob/main/Reference/Product%20decks/2.1%20-%20Prototype%20and%20test.pdf) NTs are introduced to why prototype and different prototype methodologies. Share your experiences with prototypes.

NTs begin narrowing down whether they build a large screen or small screen MVP.

* Given enough time, it's assumed NTs would build both for the product.
* Adaptive layouts are introduced, however NTs will only have time to optimize for one.
* It's an intentional design decision which direction the app goes. NTs can explore this with their paper prototypes.
* See the [document](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum/blob/main/Reference/Product%20decks/2.1%20-%20Prototype%20and%20test.pdf) for more details on how this is framed.

3 options of prototyping methods are covered - Paper, PowerPoint, and Figma. Everyone will start with paper prototypes, though there's an extra barrier to sharing virtually. Taking a picture and putting in a PPT slide or viewing as a slide show can work well. It's not a requirement to use a different method at all through the program. Teams can experiment with PPT mock ups, a great option for sharing virtually. Others, especially with an interest in design might try out Figma. A few notes on Figma:

* This is great if it builds on the team's experience. It shouldn't be a replacement for engineering contributions to the project or come at the cost of engineering work.
* NTs can create a free Figma account. There are limits to sharing projects and the number of projects. 
* Figma should be a last step after the team has landed an MVP plan.

This week all NTs will create paper prototypes and then test with people they live with if possible. If not possible to test locally, encourage taking pictures and setting up remote testing with other NTs or coaches. Like in ideation, paper and drawing this is a quick way to express ideas, especially when there are open questions and teams are still refining.

* Some individuals and teams will want to jump to high-fidelity quickly. Low-fidelity comes first for faster iteration.
* Even if this isn't a favorite part of the design sprint, everyone should be creating walkthroughs and contributing to the user interview guide.
* Ask what tasks the NTs will define to walk someone through their prototype or see where they are in the process.
* No additional product topics tomorrow. Time can be spent on finishing paper prototypes and usability testing.

### Day 3

#### tl;dr

* NTs continue working on their paper prototype and conduct usability interviews. Check-in on interview progress.
* Volunteer to participate in the usability study if you haven't yet.
* UI debugging tools in the browser are introduced and components are reviewed.

#### Details

Combining usability and interviewing with prototype and test, NTs continue conducting usability studies. NTs may have different local abilities to test. Offer remote connections and encourage reaching out to other coaches and NTs if needed.

* Check-in on where NTs are putting results. Encourage NTs to compile notes as they go.
* Ask what trends they're seeing, what's working well, where people are blocked.
* Work through how to apply the feedback they're getting from participants. Is the person in their target audience, if not that's ok. What's the participant context? Does it shape how the feedback is applied?

As introduced yesterday, NTs will build either a large screen or small screen MVP. As a team they should decide what decision to go. View component layouts begins to introduce adaptive layout concepts and illustrates how Flexbox helps UI flow.

UI debugging practices using developer tools in Edge. This opens up a new way to learn and see how any website is built and how it's working.

* If you work on web or have a web feature, considering digging in and showing something with dev tools.
* If you're not familiar with the Edge developer tools, ask for a demo.

### Day 4

#### tl;dr

* Team engineering skills continue with branching, merging and merge conflict Git.
* Component layout and UI debugging are reviewed.
* [Value prop and pitching](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum/blob/main/Week%202/%5BPM2.2%5DValue%20prop%20and%20pitch.md) introduces what a value proposition is and a framework for developing a value prop. NTs begin working on the first draft of their value prop.

#### Details

This is a great chance to share your favorite Git merging story and re-iterate that Git is a skill that takes practice. The final pieces of the basics with Git are introduced with branching and merging. NTs will follow the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) when working together.

NTs continue product thinking with the value prop and pitch. This is a first draft. There's a long way to go before the final presentations. This is the first step in articulating and convincing stakeholders that this app is valuable, gather support and / or funding in a real world engineering setting. Depending on how far along your team is:

* Ask to hear the pitch or see where the drafts are at.
* When giving feedback consider the work NTs have already done, does it include their target audience and user needs?
* Encourage NTs to practice pitching when opportunities come up. Can ask other coaches for feedback and take turns pitching to other teams.

### Day 5

#### tl;dr

* Re-iterate team engineering concepts and GitFlow - branching, merging and merge conflicts!
* Check-in on the competitor audit. Ask about strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats.

#### Details

On the product side, NTs take a break from prototyping and testing and conduct a competitor audit completing a SWOT diagram. Some questions to check-in with:

* Which competitors are you looking at?
* What non-app solution(s) do you have in mind to explore?
* Is the SWOT diagram in progress? Any top of mind strength, weaknesses, opportunities or threats?

Another incredible week is wrapping up. NTs have created paper prototypes and started on complex web development topics. They've conducted usability studies and started their first team engineering project. Take a second to celebrate. Everyone can share what they're most excited about next or what they were most surprised to learn this week.

## Week 3

This week teams complete a practice team engineering project from a sample spec - YourShare. It's not a complete prototype, the first couple of changes for the scaffolding of the app to practice team engineering and merging. NTs will be introduced to Redux. Adaptive layout, animation, and using component libraries are introduced later in the week.

On the product side, NTs narrow down towards their MVP with a walkthrough. Applying feedback from their usability testing and considering what best demonstrates meeting the user needs, NTs close on final features. The [PowerPoint template](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum/blob/main/Reference/Wireframe%20template.pptx) is recommended for creating the walk through, though if NTs are productive with another tool they should move forward with that.

The spec is introduced Wednesday and NTs work on it throughout. The goal is for teams to get coach's sign off on the spec by the following Monday. Teams cannot start working on their MVP until the spec is signed-off by both coaches. The spec includes goals and measurable outcomes, two topics new to the NTs. Future considerations can include team thinking on the business model for the app. If you've been waiting for a chance to dive in on data, data in real world development and products, here's your chance. Help the NTs land solid engagement metrics and share your experience with data in product development. The metrics should help the NTs learn if their product is meeting the user needs they've identified.

Recommended timeline for spec:

* Wednesdat - spec introduced
* Thursday - outline / draft of spec
* Friday - first round of coach feedback
* Monday - feedback applied, second round of feedback, sign-off end of day if ready
* Additional time - if spec needs more work, aim for Tuesday sign-off

Busy week, but if there's time or a team is jamming, NTs can continuously seek usability feedback on their walktrhoughs and practice their pitch.

### Day 1

#### tl;dr

* NTs are introduced to Redux.
* NTs are introduced to the end to end walktrhough and begin building one together. Check-in on any questions here.

#### Details

Redux is the next step for state management. This week introduces next week and revisits the topic and goes more in depth. Ask your team to share the data flow. See if together they can describe the flow. No need to be a redux experts. If you're blocked share how you learn new technical concepts:

* "Bing" it.
* Look for a YouTube video.
* Read Stack Overflow (might be good to point at the internal SO: https://stackoverflow.microsoft.com/).
* Do you have a favorite channel or explainer of technical content?

NTs are introduced to the walkthrough. This is a team effort to create the final UX, screen by screen, for the MVP. The session introduces what a mock up is and why it's helpful for planning and the spec. The first step in the walkthrough is creating a prioritized list of scenarios.

* Ask to see the list.
* Ask if the NTs have any questions about priority, ordering the scenarios. If there's disagreement, go back to the value prop and user needs and discuss which meets the user needs best.

It's recommended that NTs create the walkthrough in PowerPoint. Everyone should contribute to this effort. Give feedback on the walkthrough. Look for:

* Demonstration of their app's core user jobs.
* Consistent and complete navigation - are there ways into and out of screens?
* Appropriate use of button and field types - check boxes for multi-select, radio buttons for single choice, small vs. large input boxes...
* Check-in on who's mocking up or in the process of mocking up each screen?

Teams will be in different places in the walkthough process. Check-in on where they're and go from there.

### Day 2

#### tl;dr

* Teams start on a practice team engineering project - [YourShare](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum/blob/main/Reference/Sample%20spec%20-%20YourShare.md). Check-in on their work breakdown. Look for equitable breakdown fo work.
* Check-in on walkthrough progress. These screens will be a critical part of the spec. It also gives the team space to discuss the details and come together on the plan.

#### Details

Before jumping in to working on their app together, [YourShare](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum/blob/main/Reference/Sample%20spec%20-%20YourShare.md) provides NTs a chance to collaborate and practice branching and merging. NTs also get to read a spec and practice breaking down the work. NTs won't build the full app, just the first round of check-ins that create the basic app flow.

Talk to the NTs about writing a similar spec for their app soon and more on what goes in the spec tomorrow.

Check-in on the progress and work breakdown for YourShare:

* Work breakdown should describe what NTs are building and how. It can be a few sentences or bullet points that describe how the mockup will be built.
* Does each member have an engineering contribution?
* Talk through working in a branch and then merging into main with a pull request.

### Day 3

#### tl;dr

* Work on the walkthrough should be wrapping up.
* NTs are introduced to adaptive layouts, flex properties and the different properties on a flex container. Discuss your experiences with shipping for different screen sizes. Re-iterate the MVP targets one large or small.
* NTs are introduced to the spec they'll be writing.

#### Details

Teams should be wrapping up the walkthroghs wtheir walktrhoughs and moved product focus to learning about the spec. Check-in on spec progress. Answer questions. Ensure everyone is contributing here.

Again, NTs choose to target a larger or small screen for their prototype MVP. If given enough time, it's assumed their product would have both. Did your team close on a decision here? It should be based on what best demonstrates how the app meets a user need. Adaptive layout is still an important engineering concept to help with scaling and making sure the content lays out as expected.

The spec is a big come together moment. It defines what the NTs will build for the MVP prototype. NTs cannot begin work on the spec until they have coach sign-off. Share your experiences around specs and engineering planning. Revisit the concept of MVP (minimum-viable-product) to help frame scoping.

Check-in on where your team is in understanding the spec process. Topics to cover:

* The spec brings together work from all phases of the design lifecycle. From their definition of the problem statement, to customer research, SWOT analysis, it all comes together in the spec.
* Discuss the engineering work break down using the prioritized list of user scenarios from the walkthrough. For the engineering work there should be a screen and a technical description of how it's built.
* Talk about how the team is working on the spec together. Everyone should write some portion of the spec and do engineering work break down.
* If they're still working on the walk though, no problem. That piece can come last.

The spec introduces metrics through goals. The NTs think through how they'll measure success in whether the app is meeting the user needs. We don't have too much time in the program to spend on metrics and measuring outcomes. This is a good chance to dive in and bring the real world engineering.

* Talk about how you measure your product and work from end user metrics to performance telemetry.
* In the spec process help NTs pick solid engagement metrics.
* There's not a focus on funding or revenue in product development curriculum. We don't want this to block big ideas from the get go and time is limited in what we can cover. Future opportunities in the spec is a good place for NTs to include this. Stakeholders might ask questions on this topic. Have a discussion at some point this week and jump start some thinking on business models - ads, subscriptions, freemium. Again, not a focus of the program but an important consideration for product managers and a real world thing.

The goal is spec sign-off by end of week. For sign-off specs must:

* Have all sections
* Have the problem statement well articulated
* Clearly breakdown the work with UX mock, engineering description, and who's building what
     * Everyone should have a core engineering contribution
     * Everyone should have an engineering stretch goal
* Be in OneNote or a Word document. It should be saved in their team folder.
* Have contributions from everyone.
* Once ready, both coaches should say so and post in the team's team channel that they sign-off.


### Day 4

#### tl;dr

* NTs are introduced to animations and springs. Animation makes a good stretch goal for the MVP.
* NTs should have a draft of the spec done. Give detailed feedback to help them address changes needed for sign-up. Provide written feedback and then discuss it together.

#### Details

React-springs are introduced for animations. Ask the team for an overview of how they work or what they learned. It may be interesting to hear if anyone has worked with animations before or likes thinking about animations and their impact on the user experiences.

Give feedback on the spec. Written feedback is helpful so NTs have a list of things to address. Walkthrough the feedback so NTs understand the changes they need to make. Impress that feedback is part of the product cycle and spec process.

### Day 5

#### tl;dr

* NTs are introduced to component libraries. It's a good chance to talk about Fluent and common controls.
* NTs should be iterating on the spec.

#### Details

Monday is the target date for spec sign-off. NTs should be applying feedback.Talk the NTs through the feedback you're providing on the spec. Give feedback from a positive and growth perspective. Some NTs may be excited to jump in and get coding, frustrated with the documentation step. Give feedback that guides to completion and sign-off.

NTs are introduced to the general concept of component libraries and then pointed to the example of [Fluent UI](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/get-started). Fluent controls can be used in their prototypes. Talk through their walkthrough and look at what might be a good match for fluent controls. Make sure the spec is updated with controls that will be used.

## Week 4

After spec sign-off, this week NTs begin building their prototype. The target for spec sign-off is Monday. Topics in the curriculum may be revisited based on need. Encourage NTs to get continuous feedback on their app as it's built. Share with other teams, test with people around. Encourage NTs to continue practicing and refining their app pitch.

As NTs are building, encourage frequent commits and merging following the team GitHub process. Redux is re-enforced and unit testing with Jest is introduced. Stretch topics and topics related to app features may be covered by the instructors as well.

This week the details of the final presentation requirements will be shared. NTs don't need to start working on it yet, just providing clarity on where they're headed in addition to the prototype and pitch.

### Day 1
If your teams spec is ready to go, both coaches should post a sign-off message in the Teams channel. Teams can add their issues / backlog item to their board in GitHub.

On the engineering side, unit testing with Jest is introduced.

### Day 2

If your team's spec is signed off and ready to go, check-in on how they set up the project and everyone working from branches.

Redux is re-visited today.

## Week 5

This week curriculum topics and stretch topics will continued to be covered by the instructors. The MVP prototype should really be coming together. By end of week there should be an end to end working version meeting the P0s and likely P1s defined in the spec.

Continue encouraging testing the prototype and practice pitching.

By end of week NTs should have a draft for their final presentation as well.

## Week 6

This is the last week of the program. NTs should be wrapping up work on their prototype and preparing for the final presentation.

No new engineering topics are introduced this week. Instructors may revisit and help NTs unblock with any last minute MVP needs.

An additional deliverable is the presentation summary. This is a short snippet that captures the pitch and app demo.

[Details on specific deliverables and final presentation logistics to be defined]
