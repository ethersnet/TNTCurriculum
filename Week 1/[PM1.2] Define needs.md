# Define needs

This session enters the define phase of design thinking. It's the first step of refining and articulating the problem statements NTs will address and the target audience.

## Learning objectives

* TNTs will revisit the phases of design thinking.
* TNTs will learn about and identify their target audience.
* TNTs will map the user journey.
* TNTs will learn what makes a great problem statement.

## Time required and pace

Total time: 2 hour

* 30 minutes - pre-session: read Define needs document
* 1 hour 30 minutes - post-session: as a team discuss potential target audiences, individually create user journey maps, together share and write problem statements

## Pre-session

Read [Define needs](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum/blob/main/Reference/Product%20decks/1.2%20-%20Define%20needs.pdf). This document introduces target audiences, personas, user journey maps and how to create a problem statement.

## Post-session

After reading Define needs, come together as a team and discuss potential target audiences based on your user pain points and user needs investigations from the empathize phase. Make a list together. Pick two potential target audiences to create user journey maps for, everyone will make their own user journey map for one of the target audiences.

### User journey mapping

* With paper and a writing utensil, map the user journey.
* Consider what, why, and how? Use simple drawings and short phrases / words to describe what actions the user is tacking, what emotions are they expressing, and the users motivations.
* Keep it solution agnostic. Don't describe the details of the app.

### Regroup and share with team

* Come back together with your team.
* Each person talk through their user journey, introducing the target audience, the persona at the center of the journey, and talking through the stages including what, why, and how.
* Consider and discussed, what do you have in common? What was different that stretched your thinking?
* Take pictures of your user journey and save as a file in your team's channel.

### Write problem statements

With the problem statements the goal is to go from the vague high-level group problem statement, add definition, to create something that's meaningful, actionable, human-centric, based on the pain points and user needs you uncovered in the empathy mapping and user journey exercises.

1. Start by writing and thinking individually
    * Analyze, breaking down complex topics, and synthesize, piecing it back together, from what you've learned. It isn't easy. Take some time.
    * Consider who is experiencing the problem, what is the problem, where is the problem faced and why does it matter that the problem is solved?

2. Come together and share using whiteboard
    * Open a whiteboard for your team.
    * Write your problem statements on a sticky note.
    * Share one by one and place them out in the board.
    * Place like problem statements together.
    * Circle the common groups and label with the theme. This is called an affinity diagram.
    * Save the white board.
    * Take a screenshot and post it to your team.

There are no right or wrong answers. This is a first take. We'll revisit and iterate. You don't need to pick a single problem statement right now.
