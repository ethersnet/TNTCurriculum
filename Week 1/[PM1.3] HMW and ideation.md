# How Might We and Ideation

This session continues in the define phase of the design thinking phases and move into ideate. NTs expand thinking on their problem statement.

## Learning objectives

* TNTs will understand how to use the how might we framework to expand thinking.
* TNTs will learn strategies for drawing ideas.
* TNTs will practices pitching early ideas.

## Time required and pace

Total time: 1.5 hours

* 1 hour 30 minutes - post-session: as a team ideate and expand on thinking with how might we and crazy 8s.

## Post-session

Together read [HMW and Ideation](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum/blob/main/Reference/Product%20decks/1.3%20-%20HMW%20and%20ideation.pdf). This document introduces the ideate phase of design thinking. The goal is to expand thinking in a problem space and sketch a whole range of solution ideas. This is the time to go big on ideas of how to address your problem statements. The document has examples of the two team activities for today.

### Brainstorm with HMW (50 min)

1. Revisit the problem statement affinity diagram from yesterday.
2. As a group, choose the top two areas to explore further. Make sure all voices are heard.
3. Expand on those problem statements with HMW. Start a new shared white board. Write the two problem statement themes to work from.
    * For 5 minutes, individually, come up with as many HMW statements related to the problem statements.
    * Put one on each sticky note.
4. Regroup. Take turns sharing each note you wrote.
    * Group like items together to create a new infinity diagram.
5. Pick two themes. Build two concise problem statements from the groups you've created.
    * The problem statements should be meaningful, actionable, and human-centric.

### Kick off crazy 8s (10 min)

Next we're moving on to crazy 8s. You're responsible for keeping your own time. Focus on high-level solutions and move beyond just an app or technology. Anything is possible. There is no limit.

### Two rounds of crazy 8s and sharing (30 min)

2 x Crazy 8s

1. Fold a paper into eight sections and pick one of the How Might We problem statements start with.
2. Start a timer for 5 minutes. Draw something in each section.
3. Regroup as a team and share each section.
4. Repeat (with the other problem statement)!

Wrap up:

* Take a picture of each of your crazy 8s. Add it to the folder in your Team's channel.
* You can repeat this as needed to keep ideating.
