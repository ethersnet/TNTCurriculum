# Spec

This section introduces the spec (specification) deliverable. It describes how a spec is used in the product development lifecycle and provides an overview of the sections typically found in the spec.

## Learning objectives

* TNTs will learn about specs and their place in the product life cycle.
* TNTs will understand how to get started on their spec and requirements for spec sign-off.

## Time required and pace

Total time: 20 min introduce spec, 3-4 hours write spec

* 20 minutes - explain: spec and spec in the product lifecycle
* 3-4 hours - explore: write the spec
* 1-2 hours - review: review spec with coaches, apply feedback, and get sign-off

## Pre-session

None

### Spec and spec in the product lifecyle (20 min)

The spec (specification) describes what is going to be built and why. The spec process is usually led by the PM. Many members of the future crew contribute to the spec and the spec is represented of what was leaned and explored in the phases of design thinking.

Specs come in different sizes and different levels of detail depending on the project. A small feature addition to an existing product might have a lightweight spec in OneNote. The specification for a new bridge will be much more in depth to capture the complex construction process and safety requirements. Ask you PM coaches about different specs they've written.

Our specs will also include a work breakdown that's usually included in the spec or as part of a separate engineering document. It describes how the engineering work will be down, how the app and features will be built.

The parts of the spec are:

* Problem statement - defines what the product is solving
* Summary - background on why this product is needed, your product pitch is a good fit here
* Customer profile - who is the product for, what does the reader of the spec need to know in order to understand the user needs
* Goals - what are you improving in the customer's life, how will you measure it
* In scope scenarios - the user stories that the product will fulfill
* Out of scope scenarios - the user stories that the app will not fulfill at this time, what the app is intentionally not including at this point, good ideas for the app but not part of the MVP
* UX - walktrhoughs of the screens in the product
* Breakdown of work - engineering descriptions of how the app and features are being built, who's working on what
* Compete analysis - who are the top competitors, what are the apps strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats
* Future opportunities - what would you build next? What's the big dream for the product?

The spec serves several purposes:

* It gets the future crew on the same page about what you're building and why
* It communicates to stakeholders what you're build and they can give you feedback and the thumbs-up to go ahead
* By laying everything out, you can plan so that what you build is your MVP, meets user needs, and prioritize the work

In the spec you should prioritize the user stories and the engineering work you will do first in your MVP. Use this system:

* A 0-3 ranking ranking system is used to prioritize work. It defines the order in which things will be built.
* A P0 (priority-0, said 'p zero') item is a must. There's no way the product or feature can ship or be released with out the user story. The product will be delayed and not ship if these aren't ready on time.
* A P1 is an user stor that's high on the priority list, it's likely that you will accomplish all of these before shipping. If you don't it will not block the product from shipping but you would likely ship it in an update as soon as possible.
* A P2 is an user story with a medium priority. If all goes well you will likely get to all of these before you ship.
* A P3 is a user story with low priority. It's unlikely you'll get to any of these, but if you do they're nice to have. For our purposes and the limited development time we have for the prototypes, move P3 and the remaining user stories to the Out of Scope section.

### Write the spec (3-4 hours)

As a team you'll write one spec together.

1. Have handy all your work from the design phases.
2. Use the SpecTemplate.md in the reference folder to get started.
3. Create the spec as an .md file, Word document, or OneNote. Make sure it's saved in your team's files in Teams.
4. Link to your walk through, include images of the screens side by side with the engineering breakdown.
5. Break up sections or work through all of it together. Figure out what works best for your team. Everyone should be able to point to contributions they've made in the spec.

### Review the spec with coaches, apply feedback, and get sign-off (1-2 hours)

Before beginning coding, you must get sign-off from both your PM coach and engineering coach on the spec. Go to you coaches as your wring your spec for tips and early feedback. In particular, they will be looking for:

* Well articulated problem statements
* Full app walkthrough with all the functionality represented
* Clear breakdown of work, how it will be built, and who's building what
* Balanced engineering assignments of who is doing what.

Once coaches post sign-off in your Teams channel you'll can begin building!
