# Walkthrough

NTs create a final walkthroughs of their app in preparation for the spec and prototype.

## Learning objectives

* TNTs will learn how create a walkthrough.
* TNTs will understand how the walktrhough fits into the spec and prototyping process.

## Time required and pace

Total time: 2-3 hours

* 15 minutes - explain: introduce walkthrough and role in spec and prototyping
* 2-3 hours: - explore: Teams create walkthroughs together

## Pre-session

None

## Lesson details (15 minutes)

### Introduce walkthrough and role in spec and prototyping (15)

A walkthrough is a mockup that describes the end to end app flow. It is representative of what you will build.

1. To begin creating a walkthrough, first list out all the user stories. The user stories will help you outline what to include in the walkthrough.
     * A user scenario or user story is a statement that describes what a user can do.
     * A user story captures the functionality of the app in a statement.
     * For example: a user signs into the app. A user posts a new item. A user shares an item.
2. Prioritize the user stories. You will not have time to build everything. Order them from what you want to build first to what you would add last. Take into consideration:
     * What is most important to demonstrating the value of the app?
     * What is essential to meeting the user needs?
3. Mock up the screens that represent th user stories.
     * With a prototyping tool, create each screen of your app.
     * Include all of the functionality in your prototype.
     * Lay out and order the screens in the flow the user would encounter them - sign-in, landing page, views for specific actions.
     * Someone looking at the walkthrough should get a sense of how to navigate through the app.
     * Use more detail than a paper prototype. It doesn't have to be pixel perfect. The key piece is that it represents the functionality you intend to build.
4. The walkthrough is used in a few ways:
     * It's a chance for the team to draw and discuss what's included in the final prototype. A chance to get on the same page.
     * It's a chance that your app makes sense when all the features are pulled together. Is the navigation through the app clear? Are there any dead-ends where a user might get stuck?
     * It's used in the spec to represent the user stories visually and describe what works.
     * It's used to break down the engineering work. Like in the YourShare example, it's key to figuring out how features are going to be built and helps the work go smoothly.

### Teams create walkthrough together (3-4 hours)

1. Start by defining the user scenarios you want to include in your walkthrough.
      * Consider the prototypes you've iterated on. Take into corporation the feedback you've gotten.
2. Prioritize, order, your user scenarios.
3. Create together or independently with the shared PowerPoint template. Divide up the screens or user stories.
4. When you're down you should have a walk through that describes each screen and feature of your app.

### Wrap-up

* This is an iterative process. The first time you pull it all together it may not fit. You may disagree with user story and feature priority. Keep at it. Remember to keep the user front and center and employee what you learned in the design thinking phases to help your make decisions.
* Share your walkthrough with your coaches and get feedback.
