# Using Azure in prototypes

Using Azure or any service should fall into the stretch goals of your prototype. Talk to your coaches about scoping and make sure the value of your app is demonstrated without first integrating with additional services. It's not required or expected to integrate your prototype with Azure.

## How to get started with Azure

* Plan out what you're going to user Azure for first. What service or feature of Azure is going to be used with your prototype. What Azure resources do you need to use?
* The student Azure and free tiers Azure mays be used in your prototype.
* Activate your student subscription here with your edu email address: [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/)

## What to do if you get stuck

* If you hit a rate or spend limit cap, talk to your coaches.
* If you have feedback for an Azure product or service you're using, send it through their feedback channels.
