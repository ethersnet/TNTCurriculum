# VS Code Live Share

Pair programming is a great tool to overcome challenging problems or for onboarding onto a new code base. Working with other engineers is a key part of being part of a cohesive and effective team. When in-person pair programming isn't available remote pairing is a solid alternative.

This reference will allow engineers to use VS Code Live Share to pair program remotely by starting or joining a collaboration session.
