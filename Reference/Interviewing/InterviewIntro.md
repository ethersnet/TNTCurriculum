## General guidance

* Many of the interviewers will ask you behavioral questions about your past experience.  In these we’re looking to see how you may have demonstrated Microsoft Core Values and Competencies in your past.  Be prepared to talk in detail about your accomplishments for these questions.

* One or two interviewers will ask you to solve an algorithmic question and then code your solution.  There are a bunch of online resources that talk about these types of question.  We’re not looking for any particular language and we’re happy for you to use standard libraries where appropriate unless your interviewer asks you not to in a particular case.
