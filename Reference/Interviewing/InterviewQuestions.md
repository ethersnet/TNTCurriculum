# Engineering

1. **Rotate Matrix:** Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?

2. **URLify:** Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Note: if implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.)  
Example:  
input:  "Mr John Smith    ", 13  
output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"  

3. **One Away:** There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.

4. **Contiguous Sequence:** You are given an array of integers (both positive and negative). Find the contiguous sequence with the largest sum. Return the sum.  
EXAMPLE  
Input:2, -8 , 3, -2, 4, -10  
Output: 5 (i.e. , {3 , -2, 4} )  

5. **English Int:** Given any integer, print an English phrase that describes the integer (e.g., "OneThousand, Two Hundred Thirty Four"). 

6. **Return Kth to Last:** implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list. 

7. **Palindrome:** Implement a function to check if a linked list is a palindrome.

8. **Loop Detection:** Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm that returns the node at the
beginning of the loop.  
DEFINITION  
Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a node's next pointer points to an earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list.  
EXAMPLE  
Input: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C [the same C as earlier]  
Output: C   

9. **Power Set:** Write a method to return all subsets of a set. 

10. **Magic Index:** A magic index in an array A[0. . .n-1 ]  defined to be an index such that  
A[i ] = i.  
Given a sorted array of distinct integers, write a method to find a magic index, if one exists, in array A.  
FOLLOW UP  
What if the values are not distinct?  

11. **Robot in a Grid:** Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left corner of grid with r rows and c columns. The robot can only move in two directions, right and down, but certain cells are "off limits" such that the robot cannot step on them. Design an algorithm to find a path for the robot from the top left to the bottom right. 

12. **Parens:** implement an algorithm to print all valid (e.g. properly opened and closed) combinations of n pairs of parentheses.  
EXAMPLE  
Input: 3  
Output:((())) , (()()) , (())() , ()(()) , ()()()  

13. **Count of 2s:** Write a method to count the number of 2s that appear in all the numbers between 0 and n (inclusive).  
EXAMPLE  
Input: 25  
Output: 9 (2,12,20, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25. Note that 22 counts for two 2s.)  

14. **Three in One:** Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks.

15. **Queue via Stacks:** Implement a MyQueue class which implements a queue using two stacks.

16. **Sort Stack:** Write a program to sort a stack such that the smallest items are on the top. You can use an additional temporary stack, but you may not copy the elements into any other data structure (such as an array). The stack supports the following operations: push, pop, peek, and is Empty.

17. **Route Between Nodes:** Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to find out whether there is a route between two nodes.

18. **List of Depths:** Given a binary tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the nodes at each depth (e.g., if you have a tree with depth D, you'll have D linked lists).

19. **Validate BST:** Implement a function to check if a binary tree is a binary search tree.

20. **Sorted Merge:** You are given two sorted arrays, A and B, where A has a large enough buffer at the end to hold B. Write a method to merge B into A in sorted order.

21. **Group Anagrams:** Write a method to sort an array of strings so that all the anagrams are next to each other

22. **Sorted Matrix Search:** Given an M x N matrix in which each row and each column is sorted in ascending order, write a method to find an element.
