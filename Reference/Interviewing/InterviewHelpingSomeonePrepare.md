# How to help someone prepare for an interview

## Understanding your Mentees readiness:

* Find out the data structures and algorithms your Mentee is familiar with. This will help you tailor what topics to focus on.
* Find out how many technical interviews your Mentee has already done.
* Share your interview experience with your Mentee, both successes and failures. This will make you relatable and allow them to open up.
* Ask them about their weak spots when it comes to interviewing. This will help both of you craft a plan to addressing those weak spots.
* Ask them about their areas of strength since this is a place where they can challenge themselves by attempting more challenging problems.

Explain the different types of interviews that they will experience:]

* Coding
* Behavioral
* Product

Emphasize the need to have interview buddies and to do mock interviews.

Discuss the importance of coming up with an approach to solving problems versus doing a large number of questions. Learning the approach to solving problems will help them solve even those problems they have not yet seen.

Help them create an interview prep schedule. Having a schedule helps them get organized and makes the whole process less overwhelming. See Sample 6 week schedule

If you can, do a mock interview with them.

# The Approach

## Behavioral or situational questions

### How to answer

The key is direct, logical, and meaningful storytelling, answering with a specific examples. The interviewer is trying to learn about you and your response to situations that may come up in the work environment. STAR is one common framework for responding.

* S – Situation: describe the situation in which the task (what the question is asking about) occurred or was accomplished; the background from the work or school setting in which you'll describe how you addressed what the interviewer is asking. Set the scene.
* T-task: what you were working towards or the problem or challenge your faced. Describe the purpose.
* A-action: what you did, your role in the situation. Explain what you actions you took.
* R – results: the outcome, take credit for went what well. In situations where it didn't end well, describe the positive from what you learned and how it was applied. Share the outcome.

### Tips

Practice. Look at lists of common behavioral interview questions.

* Think through scenarios that showcase your experience, leadership, teamwork, creativity, and grit.
* Practice giving a short description of each.
* Be ready to describe the situation in more detail. Have a beginning, middle, and end to your storytelling that describes the situation, the problem or challenge, the action you took, and the result.
* Be honest and find examples that reflect positively on your actions.
* Look for examples across your experiences – school, work, clubs and activities.
* Be specific about an event or challenge.

Question for interviewers

## Code questions

### Understanding the question

Some tips on understanding the question are:

1. Repeating the question in your own words
2. Stating or writing out examples of the expected inputs and outputs
	
### Solving the problem without code.

This involves:

1. Solving the problem using the brute force method - which  gives you a good starting point.
2. Solving a simpler version of the problem.
3. Thinking out loud about what types of algorithms you think would be best suited to solve the problem
4. Thinking out loud - stating some of the edge cases you solution may or may not solve.
5. Pausing to listen for hints from the interviewer.
6. Once you have an optimized solution to the problem, discussing the algorithmic complexity of your solution.
7. Writing an outline/pseudocode of your code. This will help you when you get to coding since you can reference your thinking.

### Tips for finding Optimal solutions

* Think about the best possible runtime for the problem
* Think of space and time tradeoffs. How can you use Memory vs CPU to better solve the problem
* Think of alternative data structures
* Think of the bottlenecks to you current solution
* Think of the duplicate or unnecessary work in your current solution

### Writing good code

1. Use classes and methods
2. Make your methods have one responsibility, this will ensure they are small.
3. Use descriptive names for your variables and methods.
4. Start with the core part of the algorithm assuming you have methods that can handle different details. Then write those other detailed methods later on.
	
### Test your code

1. Run your code through  several examples, make sure to use some edge cases. It is ok if you find bugs, just note them and, if you have time fix, them.

## Product questions

### Types of questions

Apart from the behavioral and situational questions, a key area where PM candidates are questioned on is: problem solving, product thinking and product design.

Some examples of these questions includes:

* Product design questions - Design a XYZ for customer ABC
  * Design a microwave. Design an alarm clock etc.
* Asses and improve products
  * How would you improve email? What's your favorite app, what would make it better?
* Determining market and user needs
  * What would approach what you take to figure out what to build next?

### Approach for all questions

* Keep the customer front and center. Evaluate from the customers point of view. Ask clarifying questions to make sure you understand who the customer is.
* Think about the customers from all angles and get clarity on which customer.
     * Who uses a vending machine? The person buying a snack, the person stocking it, the person repairing it, the vendor estimating demand...
* Think about the tradeoffs from all angles. Would something take longer to build? Will something have better or worse performance? What's absolutely required for the minimal viable product?
* Consider how you will measure success or engagement. How will you know if what you've built and ship works? What signals will tell you if it meets the user needs? What signals will tell you if it meets stakeholder requirements?

### Approach for product design questions

1. Make sure you understand the question - don't hesitate to paraphrase and confirm
2. Try not to dive right into designing or building the solution
3. Ask questions to understand the:
	 * User Persona - understand the profile of the user
	 * Pain Point - what is the pain point that we are trying to solve
	 * Scenario - Under what scenario/circumstances does the user have this pain point
	 * Use Cases - What are the use cases
4. One you have a good understanding of the situation you would formulate the problem statement and then attempt to come up with solutions
5. Remember there is no one correct solution - the ideas is that the interview understand your thought process and how you are arriving at the solution
6. For the solution you create, are there alternative solutions like those, how would you validate that?
7. The solution you came up with, have you thought about it from all the angles:
	 * Customer
	 * Business / Monetization strategy
	 * Customer Privacy
	 * Technology
