# Sample 6 week schedule engineering

## Week 1

1. List algorithms and data structures that you are familiar with.
2. List CS classes that you have taken.
3. List the coding language you are comfortable with. Stick to it during the whole interview process.
4. Read part VII of Cracking the Coding Interview(CTCI). It focuses on the process of tackling a coding question. That is what we need to master, not coding questions themselves.
5. Read part VI "Big O" of Cracking the Coding Interview.
6. Find an interview buddy that you can do mock interview questions with.

## Week 2

1. Read chapter 1 of CTCI and also review ArrayLists\Vectors and Hash Tables. 
2. With your interview buddy, attempt some of the questions (2-4) from one of the interview prep resources that are focused on Arrays, String, Hash Tables and Lists. 
3. Get familiar with a tool like https://coderpad.io/, just make sure to set the language to "Text". This will help you master your coding in your preferred language.
4. Try answering the following: 
     * Did you restate the coding questions you were asked in your own words?
     * Did you ask clarifying questions?

## Week 3

1. Read chapters 2 and 8 of CTCI. The key concepts to understand are:
     * Traversing a Linked List
     * The runner's technique
	 * Recursion. The bottom up approach, which is covered in chapter 8. Just focus on simple recursion.
2. With your interview buddy, attempt some questions (2-4) focused on recursion and linked lists. 
3. Try answering the following:
     * Did you try to follow the process in tackling the problems?
     * How can you identify if a question would need recursion or a linked list?
     * What is the time complexity of iterating a linked list via recursion?
     * Have you encountered use of recursion or linked lists in your project work?
      * What kind of names did you pick for your variables in your code?
	
## Week 4

1. Read Chapter 3 of CTCI. The main focus is on stacks and queues. We also want to focus on the process of solving the question.
2. Practice questions focused on stacks and queues. Make sure you are using plain text when you use tools like coderpad.io
3. Try answering the following:
	 * Are you speaking out loud while you solve the problem? (This is feedback you should get from your interview buddy.)
	 * Are you able to state the brute force solution to a problem before you get an optimal solution?
	 * Are you able to state why your optimal solution is better?
	 * Did you use the BUD process that was discussed in part VII of CTCI?
	 * Can someone read your code and be able to state what it is doing in less than a minute?

## Week 5

1. Read Chapter 4 of CTCI. The focus should be on Tree Traversal (pre-order, in-order and post-order) and Graph search using Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS). Note: if you have not had any classes in school on these topics you can instead focus on Chapter 5.
2. With your interview buddy, practice coding questions based on the chapters you studied.
3. Try answering the following:
	 * How can you identify whether a question is related to trees, graphs or Bit manipulation?
	 * Are you memorizing solutions to problems or focusing on the approach to solving the problems?
	 * What are your areas of weakness?
	 * Did you test your code when you were done?
4. See if you can schedule a mock interview with your mentor.

## Week 6

1. Read Chapter 10 of CTCI. Try to understand how Merge Sort, Quick Sort and Binary Search work. They build upon concepts you have covered in previous topics.
2. With your interview buddy, attempt some problems. 
3. Try answering the following:
	 * How can you identify if a question is related to sorting or searching?
	 * Are you comfortable with deriving the time and space complexity (Big O) of merge and quick sort?
	 * How clean is the code you are writing? Are you able to write up your code in notepad?
	 * Is your code modular; does it have small methods/functions? Is it easy to understand?
	 * Before you started coding did you walk through your approach to solving the problem?
	 * Did you test your code when you were done?
4. At the end of the week, do a 1 hour mock interview with your mentor.
		

## Things to remember:

1. Focus on quality not quantity. This means, do not try to solve as many problems as possible. Rather try to master the process of solving problems - it will serve you well when dealing with all sorts of problems.
2. Focus on what you know. Don't get stuck worrying about topics you have not learned yet, most interviewers will ask you a question based on a topic you have already covered in school. Master the stuff you know.

# Six week sample schedule PM

Book that will be referred to in the steps below: Cracking the PM Interview - How to Land a Product Manager Job in Technology by Gayle Laakmann McDowell

## Week 1

1. Read chapters 2, 3 and 6 in the book.

## Week 2

1. Create a list of products you know from the company. Do additional research to find products you may or may not know about. Answer questions about each product such as:
     * Who does this serve?
     * What technologies does the product rely on?
     * What are things about it you appreciate? Have you used it and if so, for what purpose?
     * What are things it's lacking?
     * Scope out competitors for this product. Do they have features this product does not? Could it be added into this product? If so, how?
2. Read Chapter 10 in the book.

## Week 3

1. Read chapter 14 in the book. Fully run through the chapter on product question. This is a very key chapter in the book so spend time. Use the questions in the book but also apply it to the list of products has that you created last week.
2. Continue to add on to the list of products and further research the market space.

## Week 4

1. Keep up with the news on new technologies coming out. There's only two weeks left to your interview, so be prepared to talk about latest technological advancements and trends, focused on your company and the competitors it has. If you know the team you'll be interviewing further, deepen your scope on the products that team works on.
2. Look through Glassdoor and similar websites to scope out what kind of questions have been asked in recent interviews. Search up role you're applying for + "interview questions". The more recent the posting is, the more relevant it will be for you, so try to limit posts that date back.

## Week 5

1. Start working on the list of questions you want to ask your interviewer. Remember from the book reading that the role of PMs differ from company to company and even team to team. Identify questions you would want to ask your interviewer about what type of PM you would be expected to be. Sample questions include:
	 * Technical depth required for the job
	 * Will you be managing products and projects directly? Will you be involved in shipping projects to completion?
	 * Will you be ideating for future?
	 * How much time do team members on average spend in meetings vs tasks such as competitive analysis, market research, and product thinking?
2. Read chapters 12 and 16 in the book.

## Week 6

Run mock interviews with a buddy or a mentor. Make sure to run though a combination of the questions you found via Glassdoor, product questions from the book in chapter 14 (and your own variations of it), behavioral questions (re-use chapter 12 from the book as needed), as well as coding and logic questions.
