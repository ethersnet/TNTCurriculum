# Prototype and test

NTs explore some of their problem statement ideas through prototyping. It introduces the value of prototyping and various methods, starting with low fidelity options.

## Learning objectives

* TNTs will learn how to build a paper prototype.
* TNTs will be introduced to tools for prototyping.
* TNTs will understand how prototyping fits into the product life cycle.
* TNTs will learn how to and practice testing a prototype.

## Time required and pace

Total time: 2 hours 30 minutes

* 30 minutes - pre-session: read prototype and test
* 2 hours  - post-session: individually create paper prototypes, as a group combine prototypes, and add prototype tasks to your interview guide, share with coaches

## Pre-session

Read [Prototype and test](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum/blob/main/Reference/Product%20decks/2.1%20-%20Prototype%20and%20test.pdf). This document builds on the ideate design phases, getting into more app details with a paper prototype. It introduces the role of UX designer. Large screen vs. small screen considerations are discussed. It introduces different tools for create prototype and describes the value of prototyping.

## Post-session

### Create low-fidelity prototypes

1. Individually, Pick one solution you want to explore further from Crazy 8s, or related to your leading problem statement. Share with your team what you're working on.
2. Draw the high-level, low-fidelity screens or flow of the experience. Considering whether this should be a mobile or large screen experience.
3. You might have multiple options for a given task or user job. If you're not sure yet, draw the other option.
4. Take pictures of your prototype and add to your team's folder.

Regroup as a team and share your walkthroughs.

### Combine walkthroughs (1 hour)

1. Combine your walktrhoughs as a team. Take the best from each individual walktrhoughs and draw updates to have a similar combine flow.
2. To prioritize, focus on which tasks you want to ge feedback on and how it ties back to your goals. You may have a few different options for a task or solutions to how a user need is meet. Consider different people drawing and later testing these different options
3. Add the tasks for the prototypes to your interview guide.
4. Take pictures of the prototypes and add to your team's folder.

Share your prototypes with your coaches.

### Wrap-up

This week, use your your paper prototype to conduct usability studies with people you live with, or local regulation permitting, people nearby. If in-person usability isn't possible, take pictures and do remote sessions with other NTs, coaches, or mentors. Conduct 2-3 by end of week and compile your results with your team.
